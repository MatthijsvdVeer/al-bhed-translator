        Welcome to the Al Bhed Translator! The first program I ever wrote was a
        plugin for MSN Messenger Plus called the Al Bhed-O-Fier. I decided to
        rebuild its functionality here. This site is in no way finished. You can
        find the source code at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/MatthijsvdVeer/al-bhed-translator">
          GitHub
        </a>

        To get started, type in either text area. The other text area will
        automatically update.
